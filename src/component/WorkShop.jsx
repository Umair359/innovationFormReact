            Do you face challenges that don't lend themselves to obvious or
            straightforward solutions? Is hard work not paying off for you
            anymore? Do you need new insights to move your business forward? Do
            you worry that your ideas are not worth the investment of time and
            energy required to bring them to fruition? You may need to become
            more creative in your business problem solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creativity is the formation of something original, either tangible,
            such as work of art, or intangible, such as an idea. Creativity can
            be applied to descriptions, to how we see the world. It can be
            applied to problem solving and it can be used to design new things.
            Mastering creativity opens up a whole new world of possibilities. It
            enlists your imagination as an effective problem solving tool.

            While this workshop series is business-focused, it adds another
            dimension of thought often missing from practical disciplines.
            Anyone who wants to find and develop a new business idea will
            benefit from it. In this first creativity workshop you will learn:

              <li>What is creativity</li>
              <li>Why it literally pays to be more creative</li>
              <li>What is the role of play in creativity</li>
              <li>What is an epiphany</li>

            Participants can expect to come away from this workshop series with
            a greater creativity in every task they approach both individually
            and in collaboration with others. This includes the ability to
            invent new possibilities and to solve problems more effectively.
            Creativity is the foundation to creating new products, services,
            processes, business models, and startups. Additionally, creative
            individuals are more engaged and productive even in tasks that donâ€™t
            require creativity.

            and problems that the participants face.
